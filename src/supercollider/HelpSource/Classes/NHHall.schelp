DESCRIPTION::

A general-purpose stereo-to-stereo reverb. Both the early and late reflections are "true stereo," designed so that the reflections bloom outward from the panned positions of the input signal. Random modulation adds lush chorus effects to the sound.

This provides only the wet signal. A practical reverb should generally have a wet/dry mix, predelay, and post-EQ (or pre-EQ). Since these are elementary to write in SuperCollider, they are not built in.

For a mono-to-stereo reverb, turn the input signal into a stereo signal with Pan2. For a mono-to-mono reverb, turn the stereo spread up to 1 and use only the left or right output channel. It is not advisable to sum the two channels together due to the use of the Haas effect in the output taps.

The reverb can be frozen by multiplying the input by 0 and setting the reverberation time to infinity.

This reverb was written by Nathan Ho specifically for SuperCollider, ChucK, and Auraglyph (an open source modular synth for iPad).

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: ar

All arguments except the input are control-rate.

ARGUMENT:: in

Input signal.

ARGUMENT:: rt60

Approximate 60dB decay time of the mid frequencies. Setting this to infinity results in an infinite hold reverb.

ARGUMENT:: stereo

Rate at which audio spreads between the left and right channels. At 0, the two channel paths are kept separate. At 1, they blend together nearly instantly. In between, the stereo spread happens slowly over time.

ARGUMENT:: lowFreq

The low frequency cutoff.

ARGUMENT:: lowRatio

The ratio of the decay rate for low frequencies. 0.01 to 1 is a safe range. Set this to 1 to disable low-frequency attenuation.

ARGUMENT:: hiFreq

The high frequency cutoff.

ARGUMENT:: hiRatio

The ratio of the decay rate for high frequencies. 0.01 to 1 is a safe range. Set this to 1 to disable high-frequency attenuation.

ARGUMENT:: earlyDiffusion

The coefficient for the early reflection Schroeder allpass filters. Ranges from 0 to 1, but most normal reverbs will use 0.5 to 0.9. Higher values have a sharper attack and add metallic coloration to the signal.

Modulation depth for early reflections. Ranges from 0 to 1.

ARGUMENT:: lateDiffusion

The coefficient for the late reflection Schroeder allpass filters. Ranges from 0 to 1, but most normal reverbs will use 0.5 to 0.9. Higher values have a sharper attack and add metallic coloration to the signal.

ARGUMENT:: modRate

Modulation rate for late reflections. Ranges from 0 to 1.

ARGUMENT:: modDepth

Modulation depth for late reflections. Ranges from 0 to 1.
